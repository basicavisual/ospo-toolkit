# Federal Act on the Use of Electronic Means for the Performance of Official Duties (EMBAG)


Switzerland has enacted the "Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks" (EMBAG), mandating the release of open-source software (OSS) developed by or for the government. This law aims to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in government operations by adopting a "public money, public code" principle, releasing non-personal data as Open Government Data (OGD), and promoting openness and reuse. The law, led by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, also aims to reduce vendor lock-in, cut IT costs, and boost innovation. Other European nations and the EU support similar open-source initiatives.
