# Plataforma Nacional de Software Público Peruano

It is the platform that contains the public software catalog at national level.

Public software is the type of software or computer program that belongs to a public administration entity, and its development is contracted or carried out directly by the personnel of said institution to support its processes or services. It is financed with public funds and can be made available to be used, copied, modified and distributed under a free or open license.

As established by Supreme Decree No. 051-2018-PCM, public entities are required to share these programs.

If you are a public servant, you can:

- Request public software for your entity, which allows you to save costs and money.
- Publish a program so that it can be used by other entities.
