The aims of the CTO Council are to
make the most of existing technology resources across the public sector,
align organisational and DDaT strategies, and to make the governmentâ€™s
transformation strategy a reality.

The Council will do this by:

- understanding where there is duplication in government's use of technology
- making sure we know where there are already existing opportunities to reuse technology
- making it easier for organisations to use both formal and informal ways of sharing knowledge, experience, assets and services
- exploring organisations' common interests in areas of innovation and future tech
- re-establishing what cross-government DDaT governance should look like and how we can
best help our users deliver that governance process
- identifying areas where we can explore using innovative technology to solve problems in different ways
