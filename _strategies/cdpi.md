## What is Digital Public Infrastructure

Digital Public Infrastructure is an approach to solving socio-economic problems at scale, by combining minimalist technology interventions, public-private governance, and vibrant market innovation.

Common examples include the Internet, mobile networks, GPS, verifiable identity systems, interoperable payments networks, consented data sharing, open loop discovery and fulfilment networks, digital signatures, and beyond.
